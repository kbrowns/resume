##### Senior Principal Systems Architect
As one of only seven architects at CSG to hold the prestigious Senior Principal title, I lead the charge in transforming our Ascendon billing system into a cutting-edge, cloud-native, serverless platform. This strategic overhaul not only facilitated CSG's expansion into the APAC and EU markets—previously deemed cost-prohibitive—but also set a new standard for scalability and efficiency. My role extends beyond technical leadership; as a voting member of the Enterprise Architecture Review Board, I am a trusted advisor on DevOps, architecture, security, and operational efficiency. I am currently pioneering the integration of Agentic AI coding assistants, a move that is revolutionizing our development processes. The success of these initiatives has inspired similar transformative projects across our portfolio, underscoring my ability to drive innovation and deliver tangible business results through hands-on leadership and strategic vision.
